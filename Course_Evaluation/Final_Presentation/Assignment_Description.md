# SENG 490: Final Presentation

## Objective

This final presentation should teach to an audience of masters-level graduate students something that you learned throughout this project. It focuses on the following course-level learning outcomes:

 5. Given a series of advanced lectures aimed at graduate students and/or senior practitioners, synthesise the content in a manner that you can incorporate into your own Software Engineering practice for self-directed professional development.

It will be instructive to consider what you learned in this course that was not apparent in CSC 485C (concurrency), making reference to primary sources that were introduced in this course (SENG 490).


## Specifications

You should prepare and deliver a 15-20 minute presentation to a live audience. The style of the presentation is at your discretion; it could, for example, involve: a code walk-through, a slide deck, an interactive demo, and/or a live coding session. In particular, it should:

  * describe some technique or lesson or deliverable that you got out of this project
  * engage the audience

A strong presentation will provide a concrete and memorable example. The example does not need to be original, but the presentation thereof does need to be convincing.

A thirty minute question period will follow the presentation in which you will be asked challenging questions in the style of a master's thesis defense.

## Evaluation

The presentation will be graded _generously_ on a real-valued scale from 0.0 (no submission) to 1.0 (perfect score), based subjectively on _authenticity_. While the questioning will be pointedly difficult, the evaluation on this aspect of the course is not meant to be.

## Due Date

The presentation will occur at 17:30 UTC-8, Monday 19 December 2022; there is a grace period of **fifteen minutes** during which a late presentation will still be considered to be on time. Storyboards received by 17 December will receive preliminary feedback in advance of the deadline.
