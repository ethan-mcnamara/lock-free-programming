# lock-free-programming

A directed study course is an oppourtunity for an undergraduate student to work closely with a professor on a topic of the student's choosing. Having taken two prior courses with Dr. Chester, including one focusing on parallelism, I developed a unique interest in lock-free programming and thus decided to undertake a directed study with Dr. Chester's guidance and support.

Working on a co-op work term with Zetron, Inc. in Victoria, BC I was provided the oppourtunity to work on a fire dispatch system, known commercially as the MAX Dispatch and MAX Fire Station Alerting systems. This directed study, which involved the development of an undetermined project, was decided to mimic the system on which I worked to incorporate the domain knowledge I had gained through my work term.

Research was performed into literary discussion of lock-free programming and a fire dispatch system simulation was built leveraging the principles discused in the research.
